# CIS 5526 Machine Learning

This is a directory to house all my work from my machine learning class. I wanted to save this code for future reference, and also go back and update parts of it to fix problems both my instructor and myself found with it originally.

This directory consists of 3 folders

## HW1

Homework 1 is a an implementation of both K Nearest Neighbors and a simple Perceptron. The data set used is the "Letter Recognition" Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/letter+recognition and also included in the directory). 

## HW2

Homework 2 is uses tensorflow to implement a soft-margin SVM and a logistic regression. The data set used is the "Wine Quality" Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality and also included in the directory).

## Project

My final project was an experiment to implement a recurrent neural network to predict stock prices. It continues to use tensorflow to analyze the daily stock prices of the S&P 500 to try and predict the closing price of the next day. The data set is available from Yahoo Finance using the historical data tab of the S&P 500 (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC). The data used is also included in the directory.
